### How to run it
You need python installed on your PC. <br>
Open the project's folder in a terminal. If it is the first time you're running this app, you will need to download all the required modules that app uses. Simply type:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

The next time you run the app, you don't have to run the previous command, because all the modules are now downloaded.<br>

Then type:

```
python3 musicVibes.py 
```
to start the app.<br>


Select a folder that has some music inside and let the app do its magic! The only thing you have to do is vibing!!!
